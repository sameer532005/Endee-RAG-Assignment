Endee is a high-performance vector database designed for storing and retrieving embeddings using similarity search.

Vector databases are commonly used in AI applications such as semantic search, recommendation systems, and retrieval augmented generation (RAG).

RAG improves AI responses by retrieving relevant documents from a vector database before generating an answer.
Endee supports semantic search by comparing vector embeddings using similarity metrics.

RAG systems are commonly used in chatbots, internal knowledge bases, and document question-answering systems.
